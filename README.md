### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, My name is Alex
#### I am Frontend developer
My favorite tools for web development are Vue.js, and some times use Svelte. I also prefer more preprocessors and optimization- plugins \ hack for quick works. I easily build web applications using Vue.js (or even Nuxt.js). I really do enjoy working on accessibility, keeping up with latest web standards and practicing them. Of course all of this wrapped in enjoyable environment (VCS, tests, documentation or agreements).

From not mentioned above I also use or had experienced with:
Vite, Rollup, Webpack and other building tools
PostCSS and other common libraries & tools
Stylus, CoffeeScript, Pug and other additional languages

Other not so really important skills but also worthy of mention:
Three.js(WebGL), Regex, SVG, BEM.
Also I speak English at the intermediate level and to use on the technical side and daily communication.
Near future I want to raise my architecture skills and deep dive into typescript.
